This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Next.js Playground

The mini app is just a personal hobby in which I explore the capabilities and features that [Next.js ](https://nextjs.org/) has to offer in the ever-evolving JavaScipt space.

I intend to build put additional self-contained React components / pages within the Next.js framework for self-research purposes (SSR, SSG, ISR, CSR, etc).

Next.js is particulaly interesting as it builds on top and works with [React](https://reactjs.org/), a very popular library today.

But with Next.js, it is considered a pretty much almost a full-stack framework. Providing built-in routing capabilities, static site generation out-of-the-box, as well as server-side rendering. All with the intention of boosting app / site performance (including SEO) ü§Ø

## Getting Started

‚ö†Ô∏è The local development server is overridden and configured run against the HTTPS protocol (default was HTTP). This is merely to simulate and be on parity with remotely deployed production environments. Please follow the external [instructions](https://dev.to/nakib/using-https-on-next-js-local-development-server-bcd) on first installing a local Certificate Authority (CA) on your system as a prerequisite.

After following the above CA instructions, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Predominant Tech Stack And Environment
---
- ReactJS `^17.0.2`
- TypeScript `^4.5.5`
- SASS `^1.49.8`
- Cypress `~10.1.0`
- Node `16.14.0`
- NPM `8.3.1`

## Tests: E2E

---
[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is the tool used in this project to run end-to-end (e2e) tests.

To run the Cypress tests locally, follow the steps below:

### Pre-requisites
Ensure the local dev server is currently running (if not already running):

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### Running the tests in interactive mode

1. In a new terminal / shell instance / tab, run the following command to interactively open the Cypress application:

```bash
npm run cypress:open
```

2. The Cypress application window should now open. Select the presented option `E2E Testing`, and then select any of the supported browsers, and then select the button labelled `Start E2E Testing in <Selected Browser>`. From then on, you may select any of written Cypress tests to interactively run the tests.

### Running the tests in headless mode

Or, if you would like to run the Cypress tests headlessly, then simply follow the step(s) below:

1. In a new terminal / shell instance / tab, run the following command to run all Cypress E2E tests in headless mode:

```bash
npm run cypress:run
```

2. However, if you want to run a particular set of Cypress E2E test files, then specify the `--spec` argument along with the path to files (delimited by space if more than one spec)

```bash
npm run cypress:run -- --spec cypress/e2e/Homepage/homepage.renderings.cy.ts cypress/e2e/Header/header.renderings.cy.ts
```

## Browsers
---
The following browsers were successfully tested on:

- Chrome `98.0.4758.109`
- Edge `98.0.1108.62`
- Firefox `97.0.1`
- Safari `15.3`
