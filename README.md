This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Next.js Playground

The mini app is just a personal hobby in which I explore the capabilities and features that [Next.js ](https://nextjs.org/) has to offer in the ever-evolving JavaScipt space.

I intend to build put additional self-contained React components / pages within the Next.js framework for self-research purposes (SSR, SSG, ISR, CSR, etc).

Next.js is particulaly interesting as it builds on top and works with [React](https://reactjs.org/), a very popular library today.

But with Next.js, it is considered a pretty much almost a full-stack framework. Providing built-in routing capabilities, static site generation out-of-the-box, as well as server-side rendering. All with the intention of boosting app / site performance (including SEO) ðŸ¤¯
